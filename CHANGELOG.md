## [0.1.3] - 05/07/2020

* Bugfix: When providing default value on load the validator is always null
  * Removed all intellij files and .gitignored. This seems to be recommended. Also .gitignored some files that were auto generated in my project for iOS.
  * Fixed a warning with the validator that said you must always return something. Returning null is the proper thing to return if passed validation: https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/forms/validation.
  * BREAKING CHANGE. Removed value. Seems like its more standard to have initialValue. Replaced value for the built in state.value. In which initialvalue automatically sets state.value as seen in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/e0c63cd35e15e407a80dc44281cc392535fcce25/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/form.dart#L422.
